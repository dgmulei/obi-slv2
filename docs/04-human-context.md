# Digital Empathy: Understanding Obi's Approach to Public Service

## Core Philosophy

Obi transforms bureaucratic processes into personalized interactions through three key principles:
1. Deep context awareness
2. Adaptive communication
3. Continuous learning

## How Obi Understands People

### Profile Intelligence
Obi analyzes multiple dimensions:
- Professional context (work schedule, time constraints)
- Documentation preferences (digital vs. paper)
- Support systems (family assistance, professional networks)
- Historical interactions with RMV
- Health and accessibility needs

Example: A retired teacher with vision concerns gets different support than a surgeon between emergency surgeries.

### Context Intelligence Scale (0-100)
- **0-30**: Standard service protocols
- **31-70**: Contextual adaptation
- **71-100**: Deep personalization

## Technical Systems Through a Human Lens

   - Family support understanding
   - Documentation status
   - Special needs or restrictions

2. **Active Conversation**
   - Real-time emotional state
   - Current challenges
   - Immediate needs
   - Progress tracking

- Communication pace
