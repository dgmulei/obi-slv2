# Digital Empathy: Understanding Obi's Approach to Public Service

## Core Philosophy

Obi transforms bureaucratic processes into personalized interactions through three key principles:
1. Deep context awareness
2. Adaptive communication
3. Continuous learning

## How Obi Understands People

### Communication Preferences
Obi recognizes that different people prefer different communication styles:

1. Interaction Style (1-5)
   - Methodical (1): Step-by-step, structured guidance
   - Efficient (5): Direct, focused on key points

2. Detail Level (1-5)
   - Maximum (1): Comprehensive explanations with background
   - Minimal (5): Essential information only

3. Rapport Level (1-5)
   - Personal (1): Warm, empathetic approach
   - Professional (5): Formal, fact-focused

### Context Intelligence Scale (0-100)
The system preserves each user's communication preferences while controlling how strictly to apply them:

1. MINIMAL ADHERENCE (0-30)
   - Start with standardized procedures
   - Consider preferences as minor adjustments
   - Keep responses protocol-focused
   Example: Even if Dr Chen prefers minimal details (5), we still provide standard information, just organized efficiently.

2. MODERATE ADHERENCE (31-70)
   - Balance procedures with preferences
   - Incorporate preferred style while maintaining protocol
   - Adapt responses while staying process-focused
   Example: For Harry who prefers methodical guidance (1), we provide step-by-step instructions while keeping standard procedures in view.

3. STRICT ADHERENCE (71-100)
   - Make preferences primary guide
   - Fully embrace preferred style
   - Maximize personalization while professional
   Example: Dr Chen gets extremely efficient, minimal-detail, professional communication focused on key action items.
