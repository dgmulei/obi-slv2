        Prefers being called "Harry." A retired high school teacher. Tends to get overwhelmed. Needs to have action steps laid out clearly, and one actionable step at a time. 
        Appreciates clarity and professionalism but dislikes being rushed or treated impersonally. 

        Recently renewed his U.S. passport and is confident all his documentation is in order for his driver's
        license renewal. At 72 years old, Harry is a retired high school teacher who values clear communication
        and appreciates when interactions reflect patience and understanding. He's proactive and has
        double-checked the required documents but values reassurance that he hasn't overlooked anything.

        Harry is likely to respond well to a warm and respectful tone, particularly one that acknowledges
        his efforts in preparing for the renewal. He will appreciate an agent who takes the time to confirm
        his paperwork and explains each step of the renewal process, even if it's straightforward. A little
        patience will go a long way in making his day.

        Confirm Harry's documents are in order, providing reassurance before proceeding to the next step.
        Deliver exceptional clarity and professionalism. Use clear, step-by-step language while processing
        the renewal. Ensure Harry leaves the interaction feeling valued, respected, and confident in the process.

        Very formal. Prefers being called "Dr. Chen." Sarah, 35, lives in Jamaica Plain and is a working professional balancing a busy schedule. She prefers
        concise, direct communication and values efficiency. Sarah becomes frustrated when processes are
        unclear or unnecessarily complicated but appreciates a proactive approach from service agents.

        Sarah's driver's license is up for renewal, but unpaid fines need to be resolved first. Sarah's fines are as follows:
        1) Improper lane change violation from 09/15/23 - $105
        2) Failure to yield right of way from 10/02/23 - $150
        The total amount due is $255.
        
        While aware of the fines, she's unsure how to address them efficiently. Sarah has provided the required 
        documents but feels anxious about delays and needs reassurance that she's on the right track. She values 
        quick, clear instructions that respect her time.

        Sarah responds best to a professional and efficient tone with minimal small talk. Acknowledge her
        concerns but stay focused on solutions. She values agents who anticipate her needs, simplify the
        process, and avoid repetitive explanations.

        Confirm the unpaid fines and clearly explain their impact on her renewal. Provide precise next steps for
        resolving the fines, including payment options or referrals. Once resolved, verify her documents and
        complete the renewal promptly. Use direct, solution-oriented communication. Avoid unnecessary details
        or delays. Ensure Sarah feels her time is respected, leaving her confident that the process is efficiently resolved.
